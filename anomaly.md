### Anomaly Detection API

The Anomaly Detction API enables you to monitor and detect abnormalities in your time series data with deep learning. The Anomaly Detector API adapts by automatically identifying and applying the best-fitting models to your data, regardless of use case e.g. trading, fraud monitoring, complainace. Using your time series data, our AI determines boundaries for anomaly detection, expected values, and which data points are anomalies.

Custom models are available for Premiun Users. Models

### Product features

| Features        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Real Time Monitoring | Takes streaming data and detects anomalies by using only the most recent data points to determine whether your lastest data point is an anomaly. This method generates a new model using the data stream you send, and determines whether your target data is an anomaly. It gives you the ability to call the API every time you generate a data point, giving you almost real time monitoring capabilities.|
| Detect anomalies in past datasets, in batches | Uses your entire time series as a input,        |
| Adjust Sensitivy | Allows you to adjust the models sensisitvy to better adapt to the risk profile your application       |
