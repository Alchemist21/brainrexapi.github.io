## **We are on a mission**
>It’s simple, we want things like money transfers or receiving a loan to be as inexpensive as sending a text message. We believe money is of public interest and should then be run by the public. The invention of internet and Bitcoin have sparked a technological and social revolution , that's bringing back power to the everyday citizen.

At Brainrex we collect a lot of data and apply technologies such as language understanding, anomaly detection and computer vision to solve some of the biggest problems slowing down the mass adoption of decentralized technologies. e.g fraud, liquidity, theft.
